so this is actually a university project that i did with an depricated libarary but you can find the nuget of it which i'll put down the link here
you can use different configs for the settings of the game for example the speed of the ball or the size of the window and other stuff(for the window size you can give them as int params to the method itself instead of declaring a variable)
